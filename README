Hi there! ðŸ‘‹


I'm interested in learning more about how we leverage GPUs, TPUs, LPUs to directly improve the processessing capabiliites of AI. 
I'm interested in running lots of these algorithms and functionalities directly on the various GPUs we have access to especially the NVIDIA GPUs. 
I'm working on a startup. 
My hobby is building startups. I also play 3 instruments, speak 4 languages, & have my scuba diving license.
